## How to switch two php versions

 - just run the php-switcher.sh using ./php-install.sh or sh php-switcher.sh
   & provide the version as 5.6 or 7.0 or any.
 - another way is copy the script from .bash_aliases file and paste it to your aliases file
 like .bash_aliases/.bash_profile and run switchphp command
